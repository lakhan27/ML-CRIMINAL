# ML-CRIMINAL
Machine Learning algorithm using deep neural networks and Tensorflow to predict whether someone might become a criminal in the future or not.

There are a total of 3 files; 2 of them are .CSV files and one is a .py file. The .CSV files are Excel documents that have the training and testing data for the algorithm.
The .py file is the actual Python code that is used for prediciton, it uses Tensorflow and a deep neural network.
